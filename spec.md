Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:

[X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
  My app has a complete CLI which lists all of the days' games, then prompts the user if they wish for a recap of a completed game.
  Inputs are validated each time, and the terminal is kept uncluttered between invalid results.

[X] Pull data from an external source
  My app pulls data from the SportsIllustrated live Scoreboard. It lists all of the pulled games.
  These games are listed by league, with participating team records displayed, and the option to access recaps for completed games.

[X] Implement both list and detail views
  CLI initially puts a list view. Detailed views are only available for completed games with recaps written for them.
